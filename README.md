# DMG-DECN-02
A recreation of the DMG-DECN-02 Game Boy cartridge PCB for board repairs and restorations.

========================================================================================

This is intended as a replacement PCB for original Game Boy games that use the DMG-DECN-02 board design.

It may be applicable for games using the DMG-DECN-10 design, as they visually look the same, <b>but this claim is untested at this time.</b>
THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR REPRODUCTION CARTRIDGES. The design is effectively identical to the original and requires you to use original parts from another board.

Design order details:

- DESIGNS MUST BE ORDERED IN 'ENIG'. DO NOT ORDER IN 'HASL'! (I know. It can be expensive (ಥ﹏ಥ) )
- Two layers
- 0.8 mm Thickness
- Edge Connector = Yes (Also ENIG), 1U

You can either order directly from PCBWay through my link: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/DMG_DECN_02_Game_Boy_Replacement_PCB_b1a722f7.html 
OR you can nab the Gerber files above and buy from a different manufacturer.


Games I've seen use this design are:
- Donkey Kong
- Donkey Kong World
- Metroid II
- Kirby's Dream Land 2
- Super Mario Land 2
